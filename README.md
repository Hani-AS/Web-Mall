### A eCommerce web app created with React, Nodejs, Express, Stripe and Material UI.

##### Main goal was to explore React and learn about state management. Also exploring the world of payments by implementing Stripe into my project.

Some of the user stories are;
  - A user can filter categories. 
  - A user can see a detailed page for every product. 
  - A user can add products to a wishlist and to a cart.
  - A user can see a checkout page and make a payment.

As for state management I made use of reducers and context api.
The UI was created with Material UI.
